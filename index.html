                                As I sit here writing this on New Year's Eve, my heart is overflowing with gratitude for the incredible 7 months we've shared together. These past months have been nothing short of magical, and I wanted to take a moment to tell you just how much you mean to me.
                            </p>

                            <p class="letter-paragraph">
                                From the very first day we met, I knew there was something special about you. Your smile lights up my darkest days, your laughter is my favorite melody, and your presence makes even ordinary moments feel extraordinary. You've brought colors into my life that I didn't even know existed.
                            </p>

                            <p class="letter-paragraph">
                                Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream I never want to wake up from. Whether we're sharing silly jokes, having deep conversations at midnight, or simply enjoying comfortable silence together, every second spent with you is a treasure I hold close to my heart.
                            </p>

                            <p class="letter-paragraph">
                                Thank you for being my partner, my best friend, my confidant, and my greatest source of happiness. Thank you for accepting me with all my flaws, for supporting my dreams, and for making me want to be a better person every single day.
                            </p>

                            <p class="letter-paragraph">
                                As we step into this new year together, I promise to continue loving you with all my heart, to stand by your side through every challenge, to celebrate every victory with you, and to create countless more beautiful memories together.
                            </p>
